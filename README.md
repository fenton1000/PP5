## Idea 1 - Your Shopping Delivered! - Grocery/Retail Sales Deliveries

### Description

Create a business similar to say Just Eat but for the delivery of retail purchases. This could be B2C or B2B. For B2C the idea would be that customers could effectively turn a click and collect service into a full delivery service by having this business collect the goods that they order on another website. However, having to use two separate websites is a poor UX and integrating the process like for example on just eat is far beyond this project.

B2B would allow small businesses to offer a local same day or next day delivery service that they would not otherwise be able to do. The customer deals directly with the business and pays in full. The business then pays Your Shopping Delivered! for the delivery. There would be a system of pricing to build a grand total based on number of drops and item sizes and weights. A seperate price would apply to same day delivery. This would be local delivery restricted to say a paticular postcode or delivery radius. Perhaps options culd be added for longer delivery distances.

Perhaps the business could start with B2B with B2C a potential future growth area.

### Custom Models - B2B

1. Build order model - Allows a business customer to build a next day delivery order throughout the day a bit like a wishlist.
2. Contact/Enquiry form with model
3. Customer Testimonials or Ratings

Perhaps the fact that the product is quite different this might lead to sufficient customization of the orders models too.

### Pros

* This creates a simple product offering without the need to generate lots of product data.
* I might need to justify why a customer would pay with one off payments rather than a monthly bill. - Perhaps say it is a no commitment service for small business. 

### Cons

* For B2C the UX is too difficult to achieve
* For B2B is the business case too difficult to make and tie in with facebook and newsletter subscription?

## Idea 2 - Removals/Van Hire Business

### Description

Create a website for a business that hires out vans for self drive or with driver and helper as required.

### Custom Models

1. Inventory/Stock (to calculate availability)
2. Contact/Enquiry form with model
3. Customer Testimonials or Ratings

### Pros

* Simple Product Offering
* Easy to explain business case

### Cons

* There is a booking element to this and so it is similar to my last project in that respect.
* A good UX and use of the inventory model requires the creation of a date picker that shows availability. This seems to be a big task.

## Idea 3 - A simple retail goods website.

### Description

Create a website using Boutique Ado as a base but adapt sufficiently.

### Custom Models

1. Customize the Products Model to allows customers rate products with the rating provided updating accordingly.
2. Contact form and model.
3. Wishlist or blog?

### Pros

* Provides an easier starting point.

### Cons

* Finding/creating the required volume of product data. Coming up with a retail idea is easy. Finding one that has readily available data for multiple products or that does not require the creation of a huge number of products while remaining realistic is difficult.
* A lot of time and coding on code that is too similar to the walkthrough to count for evaluation.
* Makes developing custom code more difficult.
* Harder to make something that looks different.
